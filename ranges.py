# Range Practice #1
# Create a list consisting of all the numbers from 2500 to 2585 (inclusive). Store this list in the variable my_list.



# Range Practice #2
# Using the range() function, create in a single line of code a list consisting of all numbers that are multiples of 3 from 3 to 300 (inclusive). Store this list in the variable my_list.



# Range Practice #3
# Use the range() function and a loop to add the squares of all the numbers from 1 to 15 (inclusive). Store the result in a variable called sum_squares.



# For this purpose:

# Create a range of values that you can iterate through in a loop

# For each of these values, find its squared value (power of 2). You may need to create intermediate variables (optionally).

# Sum all the squared values obtained. Accumulate the sum in the variable sum_squares.
