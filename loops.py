  #what is iteration?
  #what are for loops?
  
  
  # For Loops Practice #1
  # Using For loops, greet all members of a class, printing "Hello" + their name.
  
  # For example: "Hello Norville"
  
  students = ["Norville", "Fred", "Velma", "Daphne"]
  
  
  
  
  # For Loops Practice #2
  # Given the following list of numbers, calculate the sum of all the numbers using For loops and store the result of the sum in a variable called sum_numbers:
  
  list_numbers = [1,5,8,7,6,8,2,5,2,6,4,8,5,9,8,3,5,4,2,5,6,4]
  # sum_numbers = 
  
  
  
  
  
  # For Loops Practice #3
  # Given the following list of numbers, perform the sum of all even and odd* numbers separately in the variables sum_even and sum_odd respectively:
  
  list_numbers = [1,5,8,7,6,8,2,5,2,6,4,8,5,9,8,3,5,4,2,5,6,4]
  
  # *Recall from previous days: the modulus (or remainder) of a number divided by 2 is zero when said value is even, and 1 when it is odd
  
  # num % 2 == 0 (even values)
  
  # num % 2 == 1 (odd values)
  
  list_numbers = [1,5,8,7,6,8,2,5,2,6,4,8,5,9,8,3,5,4,2,5,6,4]
  
  # sum_even = 
  
  # sum_odd =
